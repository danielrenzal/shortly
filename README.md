Users should be able to:

- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

(I also added some additional features such as remove button, loading animation and a more complete error handling)
